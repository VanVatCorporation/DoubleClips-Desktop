/**
 * Desktop port of Android's OpenGLEdit, synced with the Android version that is
 * already tested end to end. Kept a 1:1 port on purpose: the only differences
 * from the Android file are the type references (EditingActivity.Timeline/
 * Track/Clip/ClipType/VideoProperties -> data.editing.*); the matrix math, the
 * pivot model, speed/reverse time mapping and keyframe sampling are identical,
 * so a project renders the same on both platforms.
 * <p>
 * Platform-agnostic half of the OpenGL export pipeline - mirrors FFmpegEdit's
 * role: walks Timeline/Track/Clip and produces platform-neutral output
 * (transform matrices + per-clip draw info) that the GL side executes
 * (Android: OpenGLEditNative; desktop: OpenGLExportWorker, a separate process).
 * No GL, no android.*, no javafx.* imports here.
 * <p>
 * SCOPE (same as Android): position / scale / rotation / pivot / opacity /
 * colour grading (hue, saturation, brightness, temperature) / speed / reverse /
 * keyframes / in- and out-animations (ClipAnimation) / transitions between
 * adjacent clips (SUPPORTED_TRANSITION_STYLES, OVERLAP mode), for VIDEO and IMAGE
 * clips composited across tracks. Text, effects and 3D scenes are NOT rendered
 * (see getUnsupportedFeatures()).

     *   FFmpeg's rotate filter expands to the rotated bounding box, so FFmpegEdit overlays
     *   that box by its center: pivotPoint + R * (center - pivot), minus overlay_w/2, h/2.
