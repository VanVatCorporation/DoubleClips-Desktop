/**
 * Pure maths for moving a GROUP of selected clips and for pasting one. No JavaFX in here so it
 * can be tested on its own (see the harness).
 *
 * Group-move rules:
 *  - The whole group shifts by the same time delta and the same track delta, so every clip
 *    keeps its place relative to the others (clip A on track 1 + clip B on track 2 stay one
 *    track apart wherever they go).
 *  - Upward the group stops when its TOPMOST clip reaches track 0: nothing "jumps" because the
 *    other clips still have room to move.
 *  - Downward there is no wall at the last track. A clip may be shown (as a ghost) on a blank
 *    row below the timeline and the track is created when the group is dropped. The only limit
 *    is that the group may go at most entirely below the existing tracks, so a stray drag can't
 *    create dozens of tracks.
 *  - Time never goes below 0: the EARLIEST clip stops at 0 and the others follow.
